# Welcome to Pedantic MalwareAnalysis Journal

# Who am I?
Bsc. Computer science student at VU univerisity, trying to learn malware analysis and currently intern in a SOC team. After a CTF competition this winter, where I had to use IDA pro to reverse engineer a binary and to create an exploit in Python. Except, I have never did it before neither of those things. Long story short, I did it and it felt amazing, so aftermy exams in July I decided to double down on that experience and get full-hands on deck and learn how to reverse engineer, creating malware, exploit and cracks and who knows what next. To keep track of everything I create this repository, so I can keep tidy and neat all my links to various resources. Each month has a separate md file. I hope this can explain the reason why I am doing, and maybe help other people interested in the same topic.
