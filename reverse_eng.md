Notes about reverse engineering

## Starting with the analysis [7-16-2018] 
- [x] [Reversing and Cracking first simple Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VroEiMOJPm8&t=2s)
  - check this [GDB Commands Reference](http://visualgdb.com/gdbreference/commands/)
  - Download [this repository](https://github.com/LiveOverflow/liveoverflow_youtube/tree/master/0x05_simple_crackme_intro_assembler) or use     ```git clone https://github.com/LiveOverflow/liveoverflow_youtube.git```
  - Change the gdb ```set disassembly-flavor intel```
  - Disassembly main
  - Understand all the [jumps](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Control_Flow).
  ```
EAX - Main register used in arithmetic calculations. Also known as accumulator, as it holds results 
      of arithmetic operations and function return values.
EBX - The Base Register. Pointer to data in the DS segment.  Used to store the base address of the 
      program.
ECX - The Counter register is often used to hold a value representing the number of times a process 
      is to be repeated. Used for loop and string operations.
EDX - A general purpose registers. Also used for I/O operations. Helps extend EAX to 64-bits.
ESI - Source Index register. Pointer to data in the segment pointed to by the DS register.  Used as 
      an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the address from where to read data.
EDI - Destination Index register. Pointer to data (or destination) in the segment pointed to by the 
      ES register.  Used as an offset address in string and array operations. It holds the implied 
      write address of all string operations.
EBP - Base Pointer. Pointer to data on the stack (in the SS segment).  It points to the bottom of the 
      current stack frame. It is used to reference local variables.
ESP - Stack Pointer (in the SS segment). It points to the top of the current stack frame. It is used 
      to reference local variables.
EIP - Instruction Pointer (holds the address of the next instruction to be executed)```
