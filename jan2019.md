The journey into malware analysis continue with getting to know cuckoo sandbox, installing, config and triage. I will soon make a guide, and  drop all the info I have here.
On university siede with the class compiler construction, I have been familiarized with the term pointer analysis, something that is very important in static analysis of a suspicious binary. 

### Notes
#### General information
- There are 2 types of analysis: point-to analysis and alias analysis, but most of the time the first shadows the other one.
- These analysis include several type of analysis:
- analysis can be sensitive or insensitive aka. the compiler care to demangle the pointers mess or it places  all of them in big subsets guessing that one pointer should point to another location in memory, but it does not check it.  Therefore, faster but not precise. 

#### Type of analysis
  - calling context -> context-sensitivity analysis, "is there a method invokation?", you might need context analysis
    -  [A context-sensitive points-to analysis requires an abstraction of pointer targets, pointers, and method invocations.[1]](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/papers/2006-2/lhotak-06-context.pdf). A context-sensitive analysis considers the calling context when analyzing the target of a function call. E.g., context sensitive analysis may look at the stack and may treat the code in function Z differently if it was called from X than if it was called from Y
  - control flow -> flow sensitivity analysis, this analysis keep track of the changes of the pointers in respect of the flow of the program current state. [A flow sensitive analysis would account for variables whose contents change.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhY8_Wb40B0&index=38&list=PL2jykFOD1AWY1E3MB38_uOfpvEf4gnW80) and therefore, Flow-sensitive pointer analysis computes for each program point what memory locations pointer expressions may refer to. 
- both analysis can be performed during the compiler optimization, but on very large project these type of analysis are extremely slow with a performance of O^3. The algorithm is currently a SAT problem.
- There are 2 big names in these analysis: 
  - [Steensgaard's analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erIkdIwypbE&list=PLgJZZQPiH1mHY1ZaIlMf2b6nkozVCQPIF&index=3)
     - Insensitive to flow, context, field, ... 
     - very fast
     - very imprecise and lead to oversemplification when there are too many pointers.
     - Alias representation: points-to
     - Heap modeling: none
     - Aggregate modeling
  - [Andersen's analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erIkdIwypbE&list=PLgJZZQPiH1mHY1ZaIlMf2b6nkozVCQPIF&index=4)
     - Complexity O^3
     - more precise than Steensgaard
     - Insensitive to flow analysis
