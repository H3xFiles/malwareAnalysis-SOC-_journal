The journey into malware analysis continue with getting to know cuckoo sandbox, installing, config and triage. I will soon make a guide, and  drop all the info I have here.
On university siede with the class compiler construction, I have been familiarized with the term pointer analysis, something that is very important in static analysis of a suspicious binary. 

### Notes:
- There are 2 types of analysis: point-to analysis and alias analysis, but most of the time the first shadows the other one.
- These analysis include several type of analysis:
  - calling context -> context-sensitivity analysis
    -  [A context-sensitive points-to analysis requires an abstraction of pointer targets, pointers, and method invocations.[1]](http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/publications/papers/2006-2/lhotak-06-context.pdf) 
  - control flow -> flow sensitivity analysis
- both analysis can be performed during the compiler optimization, but on very large project these type of analysis are extremely slow with a performance of O^3. The algorithm is currently a SAT problem.
