# introduction:
In this course youâ€™ll learn how to perform dynamic and static analysis on all major files types, how to carve malicious executables from documents and how to recognize common malware tactics and debug and disassemble malicious binaries.

# module_1:

#### Type of viruses:
- Virus 
- Trojan
- Worm
- Bot
- Rootkits
- RAT

Nb: There are malwares that can be execute themselves upon scanning, 

#### type of Analysis:
- Dynamic: Execute the malware and check what's going on
- Static: Reverse engineer the malware

#### Basic tools:
- SysInternals
- MAP Pack
- 010
- PE viewer: CFF explorer, PE Explorer, PE view, PE studio
- Disassembler: IDA pro, x64_dgb, Hopper, ... 
- Other: Cygwin, md5sum, gcc, xxd, strings, Notepad++, 7zip

#### Basic commands:
Because some malwares are sensible to be seen or touched(even right click on), one possible solution is to analyze them from terminal.
```
xxd <name_file> | less                      -- xxd creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. 
string <name_file> | less                   -- check all the strings inside the file
md5sum <name_file>                          -- cacolate the hash function
file <name_file>                            -- this check fro which type of file it is
```
