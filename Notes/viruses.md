## Definition: 
A computer virus is a malicious piece of executable code that propagates typically by attaching itself to a host document that will generally be an executable file.

## History

* ’81 - First virus “Elk Cloner,” a virus for the Apple II computer. It transmitted itself by floppy
disk.
* ’83 - Term “virus” was coined by Len Adleman - Fred Cohen Thesis
* ’88 - Internet worm
* ’90s - Anti-virus software made its debut. The number of viruses exploded from 10s to hundreds, to thousands. Symantec emerged as one of the big anti-virus software companies.

## types of viruses

* Encrypted viruses
This viruses have a decrypter and encrypted body virus, so the decrypter had to be changed to pass AV scanners.
* Oligomorphic viruses
The same as before but many decrypters from 5 to few hundred. 
*Polymorphic 
They have millions of decryptors, achieve that using the compiler on the system and recompile themeselves.Pattern detenction won't work with these viruses. 
*Metamorphic virus
A metamorphic virus is one that can transform based on the ability to translate, edit and rewrite its own code. What is different from the others is that the previous the body of the virus was the same in metamorphic it change. Metamorphic viruses don’t really require a decryption stub because they aren’t encrypted. when the virus creates a new copy of itself it translates it’s existing instructions into functionally equivalent instructions. as a result, no part of the virus remains constant and the virus is never returned to it’s original form during execution, which makes it more difficult for AV products to recognize. Metamorphic malware is considered to be more difficult to write than polymorphic malware. The author may use may use multiple transformation techniques, including register renaming, code permutation, code expansion, code shrinking and garbage code insertion.
