# A all-new beginning
I did not use git too much lately, due mostly that my work and I do my writings on overleaf all my notes.
## Due to some very exciting possible news, I am here again ... 
With some very little research going on in 2019 on this topic, I am enjoying to be here again writing this ongoing blog about my own research on malware analysis.
After a new internship and new things I have learned along the line of duty, I understood what was missing from my cuckoo sandbox not very successful attempts.
What was missing is the use of the container and an orchestration process, that would allow me to have a new sandbox up and running in no time, to achieve that I am going to use k8 and docker. 

## Ghidra
I start to work with ghidra more often and currently, thanks to a colleague of mine, I have been able to get my hands on a denuvoo hiring challenge, so, 
I am trying to crack a denuvoo challenge to reverse engineer an algorithm.

## Metasploit and tenable automation
During my last internship, I had finally had the chance to automate Metasploit, although I am happy about the things I have learned, I fill that I am rather writing a new Metasploit like framework from the ground up. 

## API everywhere
Building a threat intelligence script to use intel from a different platform, I accidentally build a small API with flask. Now, I cannot stop to think about to build an API for everything. ^^

## CTF 
Time allowing I am doing hackthebox CTF, but short on time, I am not always able to keep up with everything. But about CTF, I am starting something else very cool probably very soon.

## tracelabs.org
I am currently speaking with one of the founders to help them out. if you do not know tracelabs.org is a  group dedicated to using osint to find missing people, how cool and important is that? 
So, 2020 is rocking baby! I am on fire and I hope it keeps rolling this good. I feel I can achieve some much shit this year. 

## But enough for the recap, let's dig in, shall we?
