# A all-new beginning
I did not use git too much lately **sad_face**, because I do my writings on overleaf, but ...
I rejoy to be here again in 2020 adding some new material to this ongoing [blog](https://github.com/H3xFiles/malwareanalysis_journal/blob/master/july.md) about my own research on malware analysis. ps: this blog may contain other random security topics.

## Security
### Cuckoo 
Cuckoo sandbox has been a little side project that I haven't been able to fully master so far. I hope that with the new things I have learned I will be able to finally have a portable handy and ready to use sandbox for my everyday use. 

### Ghidra
Currently working on some side project

### Metasploit and tenable automation
During my last internship, I had finally had the chance to automate Metasploit, although I am happy about the things I have learned, I fill that I am rather writing a new Metasploit like framework from the ground up.

I am currently speaking with one of the founders to help them out. if you do not know tracelabs.org is a  group dedicated to using osint to find missing people, how cool and important is that?

### Packer - Vagrant [update: 01-03-2020]
In the beginning is chaos, You can use packer alone, or vagrant alone, but they work better together. But what exactly they do? Because from a first look they seems almost doing the same thing, so, for what you need them both? 
Let's start with some terminology:
 - Packer **creates identical machine images** for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer automates the creation of any type of machine image.
-  Vagrant does provisioning. In general **provisioning**, means "providing" or making something available. Provisioners in Vagrant allow you to **automatically install software**, alter configurations, and more on the machine as part of the vagrant up process.
- Packer and Vagrant are primarily classified as **Packer "Infrastructure Build"** and **Vagrant "Virtual Machine Management"** tools respectively.

### osquery
https://osquery.io/ one of the most interesting project to work on.

### Docker
Currently I am having a lot of ideas for automation with docker, pfsense, cuckoo, and even metasploit automation, connected to my original work. Soon I am going to release a list of my docker images.
