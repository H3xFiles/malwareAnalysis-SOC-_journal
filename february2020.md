# A all-new beginning
I did not use git too much lately **sad_face**, because I do my writings on overleaf, but ...
I rejoy to be here again in 2020 adding some new material to this ongoing [blog](https://github.com/H3xFiles/malwareanalysis_journal/blob/master/july.md) about my own research on malware analysis. ps: this blog may contain other random security topics. 

## Development plan
![](https://github.com/H3xFiles/malwareanalysis_journal/blob/master/ext.jpeg?raw=true)

## Cuckoo 
Cuckoo sandbox has been a little side project that I haven't been able to fully master so far. I hope that with the new things I have learned I will be able to finally have a portable handy and ready to use sandbox for my everyday use. 

# Ghidra
Currently working on some side project

## Metasploit and tenable automation
During my last internship, I had finally had the chance to automate Metasploit, although I am happy about the things I have learned, I fill that I am rather writing a new Metasploit like framework from the ground up. 

## API everywhere
Building a threat intelligence script to use intel from a different platform, I accidentally build a small API with flask. Now, I cannot stop to think about to build an API for everything. ^^

## CTF 
Time allowing I am doing hackthebox CTF, but short on time, I am not always able to keep up with everything. But about CTF, I am starting something else very cool probably very soon.

## tracelabs.org
I am currently speaking with one of the founders to help them out. if you do not know tracelabs.org is a  group dedicated to using osint to find missing people, how cool and important is that? 


## time to brush up some knowledge and get this blog rolling. 
This new version will be divided by topic rather then the usual by date. As usual I am using 3 different computers so take me sometimes to coordinate and copy the material here. But I will try to update at least once per week.
