# A all-new beginning
I did not use git too much lately **sad_face**, because I do my writings on overleaf, but ...

## Due to some very exciting possible news, I am here again ... 
With some very little personal research going on in 2019 on this topic, I am enjoying to be here again in 2020 adding some new material to this ongoing [blog](https://github.com/H3xFiles/malwareanalysis_journal/blob/master/july.md) about my own research on malware analysis.

## Cuckoo 
Cuckoo sandbox has been a little side project that I haven't been able to fully master so far. I hope that with the new things I have learned about containers and Kubernetes this time I will succeed.

## Ghidra
I start to work with ghidra more often and currently, thanks to a colleague of mine, I have been able to get my hands on a denuvoo hiring challenge, so, 
I am trying to crack a denuvoo challenge to reverse engineer an algorithm.

## Metasploit and tenable automation
During my last internship, I had finally had the chance to automate Metasploit, although I am happy about the things I have learned, I fill that I am rather writing a new Metasploit like framework from the ground up. 

## API everywhere
Building a threat intelligence script to use intel from a different platform, I accidentally build a small API with flask. Now, I cannot stop to think about to build an API for everything. ^^

## CTF 
Time allowing I am doing hackthebox CTF, but short on time, I am not always able to keep up with everything. But about CTF, I am starting something else very cool probably very soon.

## tracelabs.org
I am currently speaking with one of the founders to help them out. if you do not know tracelabs.org is a  group dedicated to using osint to find missing people, how cool and important is that? 
So, 2020 is rocking baby! I am on fire and I hope it keeps rolling this good. I feel I can achieve some much this year. 

## But enough for the recap, let's dig in, shall we? 

## time to brush up some knowledge and get this blog rolling.
