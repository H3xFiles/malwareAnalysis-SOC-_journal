##  - Month 0 July 2018:
For few years I have been interested in cybersecurity, but lately I decided to go more into the reverse engineering and malware analysis. I am trying to follow [how to learn anything of Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). During my late night youtube zapping, I found this video from the DEFCON18 with the title [My life as spyware developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mdUcOXW6I). 
### These are few of the things I hope to cover this month:
- [ ] [Setup virtual enviroment](https://fumalwareanalysis.blogspot.com/2011/08/malware-analysis-tutorial-reverse.html)
- [ ] [Learn memory dump analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8f8avZ2V7s)
