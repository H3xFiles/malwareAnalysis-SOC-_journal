##  - Month 0 July 2018:
For few years I have been interested in cybersecurity, but lately I decided to go more into the reverse engineering and malware analysis. I am trying to follow [how to learn anything of Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). During my late night youtube zapping, I found this video from the DEFCON18 with the title [My life as spyware developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mdUcOXW6I).

### 07/09/2018
Today I focus more on programming in C after watching couple of videos that inspired me. I am currently working on a small crack.me program to give to my good friend to test him and test me. 
- [x] [Key validation with Algorithm and creating a Keygen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS4VWL5R_OM&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&index=8) - this video inspired me to write my crack.me program that I am currently developing in C.

### 07/12/2018
Keep going with [malware analysis course](https://www.cybrary.it/course/malware-analysis/).
And setting up the 2 VM.

### 07/13/2018
The issue are not resolved yet, seems quite hard to find clear material how to do it. Even if it is pretty simple in theory seems not so much in practice, I assume the number of multiple configuration provide a certain degree of variability among all the possible solutions to this challenge. So, currently I did not have time to continue with the microcontroller CTF game or anything else. :(
- [x] [Getting Started Analyzing Malware Infections](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/analyzing-malware-infections-getting-started) - too simple. 
- [x] [Create Virtual Pen Test Lab with VMware Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqfpyMIIImE)
- [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) provide materials that allows anyone to gain practical 'hands-on' experience in digital security, computer software & network administration.
