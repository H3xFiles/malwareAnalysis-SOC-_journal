For few years I have been interested in cybersecurity, but lately I decided to go more into the reverse engineering and malware analysis. I am trying to follow [how to learn anything of Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). During my late night youtube zapping, I found this video from the DEFCON18 with the title [My life as spyware developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mdUcOXW6I).

### Malware Analysis Fundamentals
Section 1 lays the groundwork for malware analysis by presenting the key tools and techniques useful for examining malicious programs.

#### Topics:
- Assembling a toolkit for effective malware analysis
- Examining static properties of suspicious programs
- Performing behavioral analysis of malicious Windows executables
- Performing static and dynamic code analysis of malicious Windows executables
- Interacting with malware in a lab to derive additional behavioral characteristics
- how to save time by exploring Windows malware in several phases.
- Static properties analysis examines meta data and other file attributes to perform triage and determine the next course of action. 
- Behavioral analysis focuses on the program's interactions with its environment, such as the registry, file system, and network. 
- Code analysis focuses on the specimen's inner workings and makes use of debugging tools such as x64bg. 
- Set up and utilize a flexible laboratory to perform such an analysis in a controlled manner, becoming familiar with the supplied Windows and Linux (REMnux) virtual machines.
- How to use the key analysis tools by examining a malware sample in your lab-with
