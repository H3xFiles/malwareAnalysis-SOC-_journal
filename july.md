For few years I have been interested in cybersecurity, but lately I decided to go more into the reverse engineering and malware analysis. I am trying to follow [how to learn anything of Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). During my late night youtube zapping, I found this video from the DEFCON18 with the title [My life as spyware developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mdUcOXW6I). 

##### The journal is based on the idea of gamification, the contenent is serious, but I am not. At the end of each day I have a treasure chest where I add all the links I do believe interesting like when you play MMORPG.(for the horde!!) The content of the chest is usually related to security, but not fit in the scope of this journal.<u> But beware that this journal or any other of my journals should be considered as a guide of any sort (maybe spiritual if you really need it) </u>.

The issue are not resolved yet, seems quite hard to find clear material how to do it. Even if it is pretty simple in theory seems not so much in practice, I assume the number of multiple configuration provide a certain degree of variability among all the possible solutions to this challenge. So, currently I did not have time to continue with the microcontroller CTF game or anything else. :(

Now I need to simulate the internet services with <a href="http://www.inetsim.org/documentation.html">Inetsim</a> a current problem is inetsim does not render any page, so I am not sure it is working properly. 

- [Set up your own malware analysis lab with VirtualBox, INetSim and Burp](https://blog.christophetd.fr/malware-analysis-lab-with-virtualbox-inetsim-and-burp/#INetSim)

-  Several inetsim tutorials like this one [How to Create a Malware Analysis Lab - VirtualBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=proAnW3TvSs) show that you need inetsim and [fakeDNS](https://github.com/REMnux/distro), but it seems that the new version of inetsim do not need the extra fakeDNS script. And as suspected the problem was in the config file: [This video does the trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGhZ0o0s7eM&t=656s) at 2:15 I can finally go to rest! 

Line added to the config file:

```
  dns_default_ip <ip linux machine>

After a small deviation in networking and VM, today I back on MWA, I am going to rewatch watch what I think so are the 2 most important series of videos I found in this journey so far:
- [Reversing and Cracking first simple Program - bin 0x05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VroEiMOJPm8&t=2s)
- [Introduction to Malware Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mz8Pu-4WVw) or in general all his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/billatnapier/search?query[=malwa]re) on the topic

In this week I wondered around the topic, setup the VM and got to know the tools now, It's time to take some serious notes about reversing engineering too. So, [here my reverse engineering notes](https://github.com/H3xHunter/PedanticMalwareAnalysisJournal/blob/master/reverse_eng.md).

This video is in my [x86_64 journal](https://github.com/H3xHunter/AssemblyJournal), but I do believe I really need to watch it again.

It's 1:21 in the morning and my cup filled with some warm coffee.Let's start the day with [Boxstarter](https://boxstarter.org/), it is actuallysomethingI was looking for. Repeatable, reboot resilient windows environment installations made easy using Chocolatey packages. When its time to repave either bare metal or virtualized instances, locally or on a remote machine, Boxstarter can automate both trivial and highly complex installations. You can use Boxstarter to install a complete environment or install a small set of tools and windows settings with absolutely no software pre installed and configuration scripts stored in a gist.

I just found this book "PoC or GTFO By Manul Laphroaig", it is a strange book, it is technical, but feel different from the rest.
[hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/bibles-you-should-read-poc-gtfo/), it calls it a bible. "For the last few years, Pastor Manul Laphroaig and friends have been publishing the International Journal of PoC || GTFO. This is a collection of papers and exploits, submitted to the Tract Association of PoC || GTFO, each of which demonstrates an interesting exploit, technique, or software toy in the field of electronics. Imagine, if 2600 or Dr. Dobb’s Journal were a professional academic publication. Add some whiskey and you have PoC || GTFO."
- Of course you can read the journal online from [International Journal of Proof-of-Concept or Get The Fuck Out (PoC||GTFO or PoC or GTFO)
