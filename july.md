For few years I have been interested in cybersecurity, but lately I decided to go more into the reverse engineering and malware analysis. I am trying to follow [how to learn anything of Josh Kaufman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY). During my late night youtube zapping, I found this video from the DEFCON18 with the title [My life as spyware developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2mdUcOXW6I). 

##### The journal is based on the idea of gamification, the contenent is serious, but I am not. At the end of each day I have a treasure chest where I add all the links I do believe interesting like when you play MMORPG.(for the horde!!) The content of the chest is usually related to security, but not fit in the scope of this journal.<u> But beware that this journal or any other of my journals should be considered as a guide of any sort (maybe spiritual if you really need it) </u>.

The issue are not resolved yet, seems quite hard to find clear material how to do it. Even if it is pretty simple in theory seems not so much in practice, I assume the number of multiple configuration provide a certain degree of variability among all the possible solutions to this challenge. So, currently I did not have time to continue with the microcontroller CTF game or anything else. :(

After a small deviation in networking and VM, today I back on MWA, I am going to rewatch watch what I think so are the 2 most important series of videos I found in this journey so far:
- [Reversing and Cracking first simple Program - bin 0x05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VroEiMOJPm8&t=2s)
- [Introduction to Malware Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mz8Pu-4WVw) or in general all his [videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/billatnapier/search?query[=malwa]re) on the topic

In this week I wondered around the topic, setup the VM and got to know the tools now, It's time to take some serious notes about reversing engineering too. So, [here my reverse engineering notes](https://github.com/H3xHunter/PedanticMalwareAnalysisJournal/blob/master/reverse_eng.md).

This video is in my [x86_64 journal](https://github.com/H3xHunter/AssemblyJournal), but I do believe I really need to watch it again.

It's 1:21 in the morning and my cup is filled with warm coffee. Let's start the day with [Boxstarter](https://boxstarter.org/), that it is actually something I was looking for and I randomly found it, because I checked the an address on the page of Flare VM. This is what is actually is: </br>
```Repeatable, reboot resilient windows environment installations made easy using Chocolatey packages. When its time to repave either bare metal or virtualized instances, locally or on a remote machine, Boxstarter can automate both trivial and highly complex installations. You can use Boxstarter to install a complete environment or install a small set of tools and windows settings with absolutely no software pre installed and configuration scripts stored in a gist.```

 <img src="https://nostarch.com/sites/default/files/styles/uc_product_full/public/GTFO_cover_new.png" width="300" height="450" align="right"> 

Sometime later on tonight ... I found this book "PoC or GTFO By Manul Laphroaig", it is a strange book, it is technical, but feel different from the rest, I felt more like I found a dusty book forgotten in a corner of some library.
[hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/bibles-you-should-read-poc-gtfo/) calls it a bible.
``` "For the last few years, Pastor Manul Laphroaig and friends have been publishing the International Journal of PoC || GTFO. This is a collection of papers and exploits, submitted to the Tract Association of PoC || GTFO, each of which demonstrates an interesting exploit, technique, or software toy in the field of electronics. Imagine, if 2600 or Dr. Dobb’s Journal were a professional academic publication. Add some whiskey and you have PoC || GTFO." ``` </br>
But if you do not want to spend 30$ the journal entries are publically available to be read online here: [International Journal of Proof-of-Concept or Get The Fuck Out (PoC||GTFO or PoC or GTFO)
](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) or buy [the bible](https://nostarch.com/gtfo) 
</br> 
But let's rollback a second,before I found that book because I was watching [ Finding a Parser Differential in loading ELF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZvc-c1OLnM&t=0s&list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN&index=10). 
Basically the idea is flipping a bit you might confuse the debugger/disassembler to not recognize the file,but it does not always work. 
- [ ] find more material on Parser Differential (Me the next morning: check for fuzzing old me)
</br>
After few (interstellar) jumps I came to the conclusion that I need to understand better what is fuzzing.</br>
 What is fuzzing? Acrroding to Urban dictionary ... I am confused ... 

- ```Fuzzing verb.  Fuzzing is caused by the lack of blood flow in a particular area thereby producing a vibrating sensation. Fuzzing is most common on the face and hands and may cause light-headiness. Common causes of Fuzzing may be alcohol, a weed-induced high or a rush of adrenaline.```

mmm, Urban dictionary might be not a techinical source of information ... , noted. </br> 
So, I searched a little bit more, and I found this explanation 
- ```Fuzzing is a powerful strategy to find bugs in software. The idea is quite simple: Generate a large number of randomly malformed inputs for a software to parse and see what happens. If the program crashes then something is likely wrong. While fuzzing is a well-known strategy, it is surprisingly easy to find bugs, often with security implications, in widely used software. Memory access errors are the errors most likely to be exposed when fuzzing software that is written in C/C++. While they differ in the details (stack overflow, heap overflow, use after free, ...), the core problem is often the same: A software reads or writes to wrong memory locations.```

Then, I found this tutorial [Tutorial - Beginner's Guide to Fuzzing](https://fuzzing-project.org/tutorial1.html) and of course could not miss the [awesome fuzzy list](https://github.com/secfigo/Awesome-Fuzzing), there is an awesome list for anything. The material is really a lot online, even a nice [coursera video](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/software-security/fuzzing-VgyOn). But, because I do prefer short guide here a [15 minute guide to fuzzing](https://www.mwrinfosecurity.com/our-thinking/15-minute-guide-to-fuzzing/)

But the best part of tonight was here to come, while I was searching fuzzing a totally random journal came to my attention.
<a href="https://books.google.nl/books?id=RNoRAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA632&ots=drUd_ONV0n&dq=fuzzling%20the%20elf%20file&pg=PA632&ci=38%2C22%2C947%2C229&source=bookclip"><img src="https://books.google.nl/books/content?id=RNoRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA632&img=1&zoom=3&hl=en&sig=ACfU3U0c8pWkhQsuiMczMWwxjzaErTGCQg&ci=38%2C22%2C947%2C229&edge=0"/></a></br>
So, I digged a little bit and here is what I found out:
</br>
```The Gentleman's Magazine was founded in London, England, by Edward Cave in January 1731. It ran uninterrupted for almost 200 years, until 1922.``` </br>And the piece of that journal that came to my attention date Dec 31, 1737 Publisher F. Jefferies. This is what I call net-treasure hunting. 

Almost 3:00 AM, time almost to go to bed after reading the 15 min guide to fuzzing. ( I hope it takes less)
</br>
4:30 in the afternoon, my brain is still tired from last night, today I am going to focus on reading the first article 
- [x] [International Journal of PoC k GTFO
Issue 0x00, ](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo00.pdf)

</br>

``` I met a professor of arcane degree
  Who said: Two vast and handwritten parsers
  Live in the wild. Near them, in the dark
  Half sunk, a shattering exploit lies, whose frown,
  And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
  Tell that its sculptor well those papers read
  Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
  The hand that mocked them and the student that fed:
  And on the terminal these words appear:
  "My name is Turing, wrecker of proofs:
  Parse this unambigously, ye machine, and despair!"
  Nothing besides is possible. Round the decay
  Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
  The lone and level root shells fork away.
    -- Inspired by Edward Shelley 

```

</br> 

In these two days I focused on fuzzing and the theory of differential debugging. Few points that I want to focus on is static analysis and to do that I want to read the assembly64 book.
- [ ] need to find some project to play with the syscall in python and in C
</br>
TODO:
- start to read this[this book ](http://www.egr.unlv.edu/~ed/assembly64.pdf) this evening
- read [this tutorial about fuzzing](https://fuzzing-project.org/tutorial1.html) this afternoon
- watch the next video of the serie of liveoverflow

Because my license of Vmware pro is about to end, I need to migrate to virtualBox, so today I had to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2wjR3pCwrU) to configure virtualBox with pfsense and windows.
Another important point is that I want to have a solid configuration, and know how to move around installing and reinstalling at will without problems. So, I am focusing on what I is the basics of having a malwarelab and it is to have an enviroment that you can mess up millions times and in few click start again.

I am currently exploring new technologies and opensource projects:
I am very excited about XIA, because it was something I was thinking about the importance of developing a new network protocol to replace TCP/IP. And then at 3AM in a total random search on google I found this:

```
Finding the successor of TCP/IP is the ultimate goal of our project. To do so, we have developed a new protocol stack, XIA. To reach this destination, we are both refining our codebase and working to meet unfulfilled demands of real-world networks. For example, our current short-term goal is to develop a DDoS protection system.
```

I am really want to try to cooperate or to play with XIA and see what is it, what can be done, and what I can help with.
