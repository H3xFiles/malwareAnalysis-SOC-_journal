# Introduction
The concept behind taint checking is that any variable that can be modified by an outside user (for example a variable set by a field in a web form) poses a potential security risk.
Dynamic taint analysis and forward symbolic execution are quickly becoming staple techniques in security analyses. Example applications of dynamic taint analysis and
forward symbolic execution include malware analysis, input filter generation, test case generation, and vulnerability discovery.
